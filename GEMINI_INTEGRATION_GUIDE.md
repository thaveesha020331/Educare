## 🔧 Integration with Real Gemini API

### 1. Install Gemini SDK

```bash
npm install @google/generative-ai
```

### 2. Update Backend Server

Replace the simulated response in `Backend/Server.js`:

```javascript
// In the /api/chatbot/message endpoint
const { GoogleGenerativeAI } = require('@google/generative-ai');

// Initialize Gemini
const genAI = new GoogleGenerativeAI(process.env.GEMINI_API_KEY);
const model = genAI.getGenerativeModel({ model: "gemini-pro" });

// Replace generateGeminiResponse function with:
async function generateGeminiResponse(userMessage, context) {
  try {
    const prompt = buildSpecialNeedsPrompt(userMessage, context);
    
    const result = await model.generateContent(prompt);
    const response = await result.response;
    const text = response.text();
    
    return {
      text: formatForSpecialNeeds(text, context),
      suggestions: extractSuggestions(text),
      visualAids: ['emoji', 'color'],
      voiceEnabled: true
    };
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Gemini API error:', error);
    return {
      text: "I'm having trouble right now. Please try again later! 🤗",
      suggestions: ["Try again", "Ask teacher", "Take a break"],
      visualAids: [],
      voiceEnabled: true
    };
  }
}

function buildSpecialNeedsPrompt(userMessage, context) {
  const basePrompt = `You are a friendly, patient educational assistant for students with special needs. 

Key Guidelines:

  return basePrompt;
}
```
